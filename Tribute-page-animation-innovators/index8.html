            <h2>A Little Disney Background</h2>
                <p><span class="name">Walt Disney</span> was born in 1901 in Chicago, Illinois. He had four siblings. From a very early age, he loved to draw and create silly characters born from his imagination. His older brother, Roy, was an early admirer and encouraged him to pursue his dream as a cartoonist. While Walt was in high school, he regularly canvased his neighborhood, selling his cartoons to anyone who would buy them. When he was 18, he joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps and was stationed in France for one year. In addition to medical supplies and equipment, it is rumored his ambulance was plastered with cartoon drawings everywhere he went!</p>
